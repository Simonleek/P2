P2: PHP Basics
- The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the basics of PHP.

Task
- Create an xkcd style password generator. (http://xkcd.com/936/)

Goals
- Landing page includes a description of your app and what a xkcd password is (assume an unfamiliar audience).
- Form inputs to specify:
	- How many words to use.
	- Whether to include a number.
	- Whether to include a special symbol (for example, @).
	- Whether to upper case the first letter of the password.

Extra Challenges
	- Add more configurations:
		- How many special characters.
		- Spaces or camel case or hyphens.
		- Max length.
		- All upper case, or all lower case, or make the first letter of each word upper case.
		- Etc...

Error checking: For example, what happens if a user enters a string instead of an integer for # of words?
- Scrape an online word list to build a really long word list. (No clue where to start? Here's an outline for approach).
- Make it look nice.
- Misc

When completed, do not forget to add the link to your project and its Github repository to your P1 Portfolio.
